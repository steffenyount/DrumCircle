Things I looking at for the next release:

DrumCircle To Do List:

-Put a menus on Key/Instrument buttons in place of sliders

-Add Sliders so display will always fit in desktop

-Add saveable general settings (superset of all the profile list, BPM, etc)

-Get auto open to work

-Add a Midi Out Option Menu

-Make dots part of binary
